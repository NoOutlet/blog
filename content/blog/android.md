I have a goal to understand how to build an Android app. So I've been following [these tutorials](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/android-kotlin-fundamentals/) and they are great, but it is difficult to find the place to start given that I've been working in web development for quite some time.

So far, I've built a very simple dice rolling app and a click counting game. I guess we'll see where I can go from here.
