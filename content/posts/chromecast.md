## HBO Max

Recently my wife and I were talking about [HBO Max](https://www.hbomax.com/). I had thought that I had heard we already had it by being HBO subscribers, but she was under the impression that it costs more money to get HBO Max than regular HBO. So we looked it up and I found it confusing because under some providers the HBO Max content is included, but not under other providers. The information I found seemed to suggest that [Hulu (through which we access our HBO content) was a provider that would show HBO Max content](https://www.hbomax.com/do-i-already-have-access). So everything was good. Right? Well, we found some movies that should show up if we had HBO Max (the Studio Ghibli films). We searched on Hulu, but none of them were showing up. Eventually I installed the HBO Max app on my Android phone and found that the films _were there_ in the app.

## Justifying the Chromecast

Now we needed to look into options for getting HBO Max on our fancy living room TV. We have a smart TV so the most convenient thing would be if there was a [WebOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebOS) HBO Max app, but there isn't. We have a Nintendo suite of consoles, none of which have HBO Max. We have a Roku stick, but the remote unpaired from the stick and there doesn't seem to be a lot we can do about that. It was looking like the best option was going to be a Chromecast. It would mean that we would have to control the video on our phones / tablets which I don't find to be a great experience. On the plus side, we've somewhat recently switched our [phone service to Google Fi](https://g.co/fi/r/ECVE9V)(which we love) and as a bonus they have sent us a bunch of [Google Nest Minis](https://store.google.com/us/product/google_nest_mini) so we already have a Google Home network of devices. Also, it's only like \$30 for the 1080p version. So decided to get the Chromecast.

## Using the Chromecast

Installation was brain-dead simple. Plug it in to power and TV. Then follow the instructions on the screen and in the Google Home app. Once it was set up I tried out playing some videos. The apps that support it get a little Chromecast icon when the device is recognized on the network. The videos from HBO Max play great though my wife played some streaming video from a Facebook Live stream and the quality was pretty bad there. We did have a little trouble when we took the device to the upstairs bedroom where the Wifi connection gets lost sometimes. It makes sense that it would drop the video, but the amount of restarting of apps that was required after re-connecting was pretty annoying.

## The buried lead

Once you set the Chromecast up you also get to choose what it shows when a video is not casting. While it isn't the main feature of the Chromecast, this has been a huge hit in our house. If you have Google Fi (or maybe an Android phone in general?), you probably back up your photos with Google Photos. You can set your Chromecast to idle with pictures from your albums. You can even set it to filter only the pictures that include certain people in them (which is creepily accurate). That means we miss out on any landscape-only pictures from camping trips, but it also means we're skipping the 40% of our photos that are meals. We have literally spent an hour watching this screensaver. After all, it allows us to relive the good parts of our kids growing up. And _that_ has been magical.
