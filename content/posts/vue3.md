[Vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) was released in September and I've been waiting for this to happen for a long while. I was excited for the new features, so I decided to upgrade NoOutlet.net to the new version of Vue.
However, I had previously been messing around with [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) (partially so that I could build this blog) and so the entire site had already been completely converted into a Nuxt app. At the moment, that is still the condition of the published version of the site.
Converting from Nuxt (Vue 2) back to SPA Vue 3 has not been quite as trivial as converting from SPA Vue 2 to Nuxt (Vue 2) was. As a result many of the pages are mostly or completed busted. I'm working on getting the pages back up and hopefully improved with the new Vue 3 features.
